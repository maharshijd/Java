/* Pointers allow direct access to memory addresses. If a programmer changes a wrong address, it can overwrite important data, crash the program, or create security risks. This makes programs unreliable and harder to debug.

Java was designed with three clear goals:

Security – Users should not access or modify memory directly.

Reliability – Programs should not crash due to memory misuse.

Simplicity – Developers should focus on logic, not memory management.

To achieve this, Java uses references instead of pointers.
A reference lets you access an object, but you cannot:

Perform pointer arithmetic

Access raw memory

Modify memory addresses

Memory is handled automatically using garbage collection, which removes unused objects safely. */
